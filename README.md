# Edge-and-Corner-Detection
The goal of this project is doing edge and corner detection. 

## Canny for Edge Detection 
Canny edge detector is the technique that  has been used for edge detection. The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images.

## Haris Corner Detector
I have used Harris Corner Detector in this project since it is a corner detection operator that is commonly used in computer vision algorithms to extract corners and infer features of an image.

To get the better result the upsampling has been done in this code.
